# **Microsoft: Classifying Cybersecurity Incidents Using Machine Learning**

## **Overview**

This project focuses on developing a **machine learning classification model** to enhance the cybersecurity operations at **Microsoft**, particularly in **Security Operation Centers (SOCs)**. The primary goal was to classify cybersecurity incidents into categories such as **True Positive (TP)**, **Benign Positive (BP)**, and **False Positive (FP)** with high accuracy. 

By applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques and extensive data preprocessing, I achieved an **accuracy of 93%** in classifying incidents. This model greatly improves the incident triage process and response automation, streamlining the work of SOC analysts by providing real-time, context-rich recommendations.

## **Skills Gained**

Through this project, I gained experience in:
- **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**: Cleaning, transforming, and optimizing features for machine learning models.
- **Machine Learning Classification Algorithms**: Implementing algorithms like **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **Neural Networks** to solve classification problems.
- **Model Evaluation Metrics**: Using performance metrics such as **Macro-F1 Score**, **Precision**, and **Recall** to ensure balanced performance across all classes.
- **Cybersecurity Concepts**: Understanding frameworks like **MITRE ATT&CK** to ensure that the model aligns with real-world security scenarios.
- **Handling Imbalanced Datasets**: Techniques such as **SMOTE** and class-weight adjustments to handle class imbalances and improve model performance.
- **Model Optimization**: Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to maximize accuracy and model efficiency.

The model’s **93% accuracy** demonstrates its ability to significantly enhance SOC workflows, reducing false positives and improving response times to security threats.

## **Project Problem Statement**

### **Objective**

The main objective was to develop a robust **machine learning model** capable of classifying cybersecurity incidents accurately to support **SOC analysts** at Microsoft. The model predicts the triage grade of incidents based on historical data, enabling SOC teams to focus on critical security threats and automate responses. 

### **Project Scope**

The dataset provided by **Microsoft** contained detailed cybersecurity incidents across different levels: evidence, alerts, and incidents. The project included:
- **Data Exploration**: Analyzing the structure of the dataset and the distribution of target variables.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, performing feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Model Development**: Building classification models that can accurately classify incidents as TP, BP, or FP.
- **Model Evaluation**: Measuring performance using metrics like **macro-F1 score**, **precision**, and **recall** on a separate test set to ensure generalizability.

### **Key Features**

- **Accurate Triage Prediction**: The machine learning model predicts whether a cybersecurity incident is **true positive**, **benign positive**, or **false positive**.
- **Automation for SOC Analysts**: The model is designed to be integrated into SOC workflows, providing analysts with real-time insights and actionable recommendations.
- **93% Accuracy**: The high accuracy ensures that the model can reliably handle real-world scenarios and effectively supports SOC decision-making processes.

## **Deployment**

The final machine learning model can be deployed within **Microsoft’s SOC systems** to automate incident classification and provide SOC analysts with precise triage recommendations. By integrating this model, SOC teams can prioritize critical incidents more efficiently, reduce false positives, and improve response times to genuine threats.

## **Conclusion**

This project showcases the significant role that **machine learning** can play in automating and improving **cybersecurity operations**. By achieving an **accuracy of 93%** in classifying incidents, the model helps **SOC analysts** at Microsoft to better manage and respond to security incidents, ultimately enhancing the overall security posture of enterprise environments. The automation of incident triage with this model provides a scalable solution for enterprise security, reducing manual workload and enabling quicker threat mitigation.

With further tuning, this model could serve as a foundational tool for **enterprise-level cybersecurity defense**, making SOC operations more efficient and accurate.
